# My solution to the Gilded Rose Kata

My answer to the [Gilded Rose Kata by EmilyBache](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata) in Javascript.

### Instructions
To test or run this project:
1. Clone project
1. Run `$ npm install`
1. Run `$ npm test`

I've attached a `log` file, in case you are not able to run the script by yourself.

If you want to create a new `log` file, just run `$ npm test > log`.
